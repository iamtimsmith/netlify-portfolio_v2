# Hey There!

My name is Tim Smith and I'm a full-stack web developer. I build back-ends using PHP and Node js with frameworks such as Laravel and Express js. I use React js, Wordpress, Blade, Pug, and more to build enjoyable user experiences on the front-end.

When I'm not building things for the web, I enjoy spending time with my wife and daughters who always know how to have fun. I also attend online classes for my AAS in Web Development, which I will be receiving in 2019.

If you have an idea for a project you'd like to work on, just use the contact form on this page and you can reach me directly!
